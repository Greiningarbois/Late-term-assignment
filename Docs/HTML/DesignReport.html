<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We are implementing the game, Tic-Tac-Toe using Circle Ci, Node and Heroku. We set a couple of rules regarding the code structure to keep the code consistant and clean.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>For the late term assignment we implemented the game Tic-Tac-Toe using Agile development techniques. The game Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that was invented along time ago and usually is played on a piece of paper where players take turn to put 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, and trying to get a 3 in a row, either diagonally, vertically or horizontally.
We used Javascript to implement the logic behind the game and used test driven development to test every function to make sure the game runs bug free.</p>
